# NOTE: support key value pairs

# indent_style
#
# Set to tab or space to use hard tabs or soft tabs respectively. The values are case insensitive.
#
# indent_size
#
# Set to a whole number defining the number of columns used for each indentation level and the width of soft tabs (when supported). If this equals tab, the indent_size shall be set to the tab size, which should be tab_width (if specified); else, the tab size set by the editor. The values are case insensitive.
#
# tab_width
#
# Set to a whole number defining the number of columns used to represent a tab character. This defaults to the value of indent_size and should not usually need to be specified.
#
# end_of_line
#
# Set to lf, cr, or crlf to control how line breaks are represented. The values are case insensitive.
#
# charset
#
# Set to latin1, utf-8, utf-8-bom, utf-16be or utf-16le to control the character set. Use of utf-8-bom is discouraged.
#

#
# The format is ss or ss-TT, where ss is an ISO 639 language code and TT is an ISO 3166 territory identifier.
#
# Note: This property does not specify the charset to be used. The charset is in separate property charset.
#
# trim_trailing_whitespace
#
# Set to true to remove all whitespace characters preceding newline characters in the file and false to ensure it doesn’t.
#
# insert_final_newline
#
# Set to true ensure file ends with a newline when saving and false to ensure it doesn’t.
#
